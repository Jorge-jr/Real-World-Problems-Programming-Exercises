# Exercises
This is a set of some programming exercises based on real world problems.

### Python

1. <details><summary>Grep like search</summary><p>This exercise involves creating a script that can search for specific patterns or keywords in a given text file, similar to the Unix "grep" command.</p><p>Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKzonnwoR2I </p><details>
3. <details><summary>Sudoku</summary>This exercise involves writing a program to create and solve a Sudoku puzzle. The goal is to create an algorithm that can fill in all the empty squares on a 9x9 Sudoku grid according to the game's rules.</p><p>Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lhxIOAfDss</p></details>
4. <details><summary>Hamming code</summary><p><p>This exercise involves implementing a Hamming code encoder and decoder. Hamming codes are a type of error-correcting code used in digital communications to detect and correct errors that may occur during transmission.</p><p>Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA&t=331s </p></details>
5. <details><summary>Function roots with Newton's method</summary><p>This exercise involves writing a program to find the root of a given function using the Newton's method. The goal is to create an algorithm that can approximate the root of a function with high accuracy.</p></details>


### Elixir

1. <details><summary>Functional sudoku</summary><p>This exercise involves creating a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle using functional programming principles in Elixir. The program should be able to generate random Sudoku puzzles and solve them using a recursive algorithm.</p></details>
2. <details><summary>Pi's value with parallel Monte Carlo method</summary><p>This exercise involves approximating the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method in a parallel way with Elixir. The program should generate a large number of random points within the unit square, calculate the distance of each point to the origin, and then use the ratio of the number of points inside the unit circle to the total number of points generated to approximate the value of Pi. The program should use parallelism to speed up the calculations.</p></details>
